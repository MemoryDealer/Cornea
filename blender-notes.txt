-To properly prepare a mesh with a texture for exporting: Create mesh, and give it the name, then create material and give same name, then texture and give same name. 
	Then split the window and go to UV/Image mode, select the image (should be in the drop-down menu already) and then in the 3d viewport go to edit mode and press U->unwrap. 
	Now it's ready to export. 
	-If it won't unwrap then press U->Reset.
-Instead of going through all that, in the texture tab, go down to Mapping and change the Coordinates mode to UV, from there it can all be arranged. 
-Recalculate normals outside (Ctrl + N).
-Recalculate normals inside (Ctrl + Shift + N). 
-To create a tunnel, create the cylinder first, then duplicate it, don't move it and invert the normals to the inside.
-If an object was created in Object Mode, move the cursor to the center and then move the object's origin to the 3D Cursor.
-For snapping walls together, set snap to face, and choose closest. Then select the whole object and point the viewport in the direction of the object you wish to snap to,
	then drag it until it snaps to the face. 

-CHANGE CLIPPING DISTANCE

-For proper normals I must do all scaling directly to the mesh by	 using edit mode.

-In the properties, the Object name is the name of the scene node that's created, and the Object Data name is the name of the .mesh file that's created.
-I had to recalculate the normals on a block to get the lighting in Ogre to work on it, not sure why this was needed. 
-I'm not sure if I can devise a way to export materials to inherit the diffuse_template.

-Had problems with getting the exported mesh to texture properly. The solution is here: http://www.ogre3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=46929&start=0&hilit=blender+texture
	Be in Blender. Create an object/mesh, a cube.
	Select that object.
	Press TAB to enter edit mode.
	Select all vertices/faces, if not already selected.
	Press U and select, for instance, UV Cube projection.
	Now, open the UV Editor window.
	You should hopefully see the uv map in this 2D view.
	Open an image (open image, browse) and select one.

	Image is now under the UV map.
	Go back to the 3D view window.
	Turn on textured render mode.
	Press TAB to exit edit mode.
	What do you see?
	A textured cube, hopefully.
	It is ready for exporting.

-I've had pretty good luck with vertex snapping when forming a room.
