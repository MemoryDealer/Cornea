# CRITICAL
- Random segfault on updateNPCs in event manager when firing projectiles not directly at it while riding on elevator. 
# - 

# AVERAGE
- Sometimes projectiles make it through the floor plane.
- Jumping straight against a wall makes the player get stuck, and slide down the wall slowly.
- Casting a ray from a moving platform causes the origin/direction of the ray to be offset. I will need to visualize this to debug. 
- Sometimes when starting the game or warping all of the objects disappear and there is nothing but the skybox (caused by updateFooting() in camera).
- I crashed it in release mode after firing probably 500+ projectiles with lights. Perhaps the lights/billboards are not being freed properly. 
- Possible frame stuttering, look into setFrameSmoothingRate again. 
- Weapon shakes when player is moving or turning when the player is farther away from the origin. 
- When switching back and forth between two weapons, the animation restarts and the player can fire again too soon (and muzzlelight gets duplicated--exception thrown). 
# - 

# MINIMAL
- Random crash when pressing E to activate pointing at nothing.
- Possible error still exists when casting a ray forward every frame in updateUI() when retrieving the scene node via collision object user pointer. 
# -  

# POSSIBLE
- Passing a copy of timeSinceLastFrame so many times might be wasting memory, could try a reference if perfmormance needs enhancement. 
- Not sure if a "shadow camera" is needed. I can remove the listener from the scene manager and I don't see a difference. 
- Memory leak when exiting game state ~1 MB
